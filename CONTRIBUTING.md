#Contributing to Pinoc

Contributing is pretty simple in this small project. Create a fork in your own repository space, make whatever modifications you're interested in, then open a pull request.
I'll review it and we can discuss the changes in the PR. Once I'm satisfied, I'll be happy to merge your changes.

For CAD / STL files, please only include the final STL files you would slice and print. Where possible, make your CAD files parameterized so different binocular / telescope sizes are easier to accommodate.

##Python Style

Any python code should use spaces for indentation, and 4 spaces per indent.

##License

You will be making contributions to a GPLv3 project, which means any modifications we make must be released as open-source software.
