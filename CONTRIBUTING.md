#Contributing to PiClipse

Contributing is pretty simple in this small project. Create a fork in your own repository space, make whatever modifications you're interested in, then open a pull request.
I'll review it and we can discuss the changes in the PR. Once I'm satisfied, I'll be happy to merge your changes.

Please note: your contributions are to a GPLv3 project, which means any modifications we make will be released as open-source software.
